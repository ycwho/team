Meeting 1 - 21/02/2020
All present

Info: Meeting scheduled for after the SW tutorial

Prior to meeting
 had created a facebook group through which to communicate. Before the meeting there was a wide consensus to do a game

Chatting about what the project will be
Met in person to discuss potential projects
Scott suggested Battleships, Stittle and Liz happy about this plan
Nin and Chao were unsure of what it was
Chao proposed chess
Scott expressed that chess was probably more complicated game-wise and had been partially covered in the SWW lectures which felt like reasons to choose something else
Ning and Chao were happy to follow battleships after being convinced it was an easy game by the others

Planned a meeting for the following Tuesday after researching the project more
Chao and Ning to learn the game, if not convinced then option to change to a different game
Task to understand servers and clients better - appropriate resources were shared 



Meeting 2 - 25/02/2020:
All present

Info: meeting following a shared AI lecture

Prior to meeting 
learning resources were shared online and Scott created a google drive for the project with a very simplistic view of a structure of the game, along with features that could be included

Start of meeting
Chao and Ning confirmed they were happy with the game after researching it

Discussed the assignment of roles in the project
Liz expressed her interest in working with the GUI
Ning expressed interest in working on the database
Chao also wanted to work on the database
Stittle interested in working on the client-server system
Scott also happy to work on the client-server system
As everyone’s interests seemed to split the group evenly into the three parts of the system, it was agreed upon that this would be the division
Scott, having been the most vocal so far also agreed to be the group secretary and coordinator/leader for the group

Plans for next meeting
Liz stated she would be in london for the weekend
Scott suggested scheduling the free day of monday to be set aside for the next meeting and groupwork

Tasks until next meeting:
Familiarise ourselves with GIT
Try writing the start of our respective sections of code
Finalise project structure


Meeting 3 (Tutorial with Alex) - 28/02/20:
Liz not present as in London

Info: Tutorial with Alexandros

Had been concerned that Battleships might not work as doesn’t naturally lend itself to more than 2 players
Scott proposed potentially doing a spectator mode for the game
Alexandros was happy with idea but also stated that it could be worth bending the rules of the game to allow for a multiplayer version

Discussed use of databases in the project
The structure of the project we were planning on implementing was to store the ship positions during the game in a database
Alex said that complex use of database was advised, but to choose whatever implementation we chose for where to store the ship positions

Reassigning tasks
ALex encouraged Chao to not work on the database, but instead work on the server-client with Scott and Stittle


Meeting 4 - 28/02/20:
Liz not present as in London

Info: Brief meeting following the tutorial to confirm what was discussed in the tutorial and plans for the weekend
Confirming project would be battleships
Discussing structure of the project
Confirming Chao would be happy to move to the server and client


Meeting 5 - 02/03/20:
All present

Info: Discussing the work that had been done over the week so far, followed by a group working session for the whole day to hit our targets for the week.

Discussed what we had produced so far
Stittle had worked on a login system using the server and client for 1 user
Chao had worked on his own client server system handling multiple client and the start of the game code
Ning (working with Chao at the beginning) had produced a working database login method
Scott spent his time editing code that had been written
Liz had worked on the GUI to give a simple game system

After end of meeting
Stittle and Scott discussed the use of scenebuilder and fmxl files to help run our GUIs, subsequently Menus were created in this way

Set out Tasks for next week:
Liz to continue with game GUI, seeing if scenebuilder would be helpful in this case
Henry finishing the login system and implementing a GUI to it
Ning to create database method to allow ship positions to be stored in database
Chao working on the server to get multiple clients to log on and join a common game
Scott to start writing the game logic within the server


Meeting 6 - 06/03/20:
All Present

Info: Alex wasn’t around so instead of tutorial meeting had a group working session

Discussed what had been done
People had done the majority of their tasks
Chao had managed to get a whole command-line game working effectively

Tasks in the meeting
Chao and Stittle worked on merging the code
Ning and Liz continued with their tasks
Scott wrote a document describing how the code and methods were working


Meeting 7 - 11/03/20:
All Present

Info: Similar to prior meeting, to work, touch base about what had been produced and set upcoming tasks

Discussions
How overall structure of the code was working
Advantage of scenebuilder and controller style GUI’s
Desired options for the game, eg storing ship layouts in the database before a game
Ships in game will not be stored in database but in an array as in Chao’s game

Allocation of work for the coming week:
Scott connecting the command line game to the GUI
Stittle the main menu systems
Chao updating the game system for different options
Ning writing code to store positions of ships into database and testing
Liz, updating the GUI to be able to handle the methods that are required of it now we were sure of what they were


Meeting 7 - 13/03/20:
Alex tutorial meeting
All present

Info: DIsplayed what we had produced and what was expected of us

Discussed use of databases and structure

Discussed what was expected in the project
update automatically the online users
work between lab computers
Tests - Whitebox testing, labbox testing, manual testing (of gui), individual testing then integration testing
Asked questions such as do we synchronize the database
Need to be aware about all of our decisions
After meeting Scott suggested coming in Saturday from midday with the target to get the system working
Meeting 8 - 14/03/20:
All present
Info: Group work session all day working in the labs almost getting it all together
Pushed code together and redesigned aspects of the GUI
Started the compiling of a todo list to help coordinate where time would be spent
Assigned tasks for the coming week
Stittle and Chao: trying to get the code working then commenting and streamlining
Scott: start writing report
Ning: finishing, then testing and populating the database and then doing diagrams of it
Liz: updating GUI methods then testing the GUI and then helping on the report

Meeting 9 - 19/03/20:
All present
Info: Group meeting with Alex
Discussed: closing servers which we didn’t catch at the time, was some confusion over how/whether the different clients were communicating with each other, effective testing, what should go into the report, diagrams and if we should prioritise either the scope or the reliability of the code
